## Description

_\<The assignment was to do the problems in the instructions, as well as problems from the textbook. The ones in the instructions dealt with printing out sequences. And the ones in the textbook dealt with various topics.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to use loops to get designs and sequences through numbers plugged in to the program.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
